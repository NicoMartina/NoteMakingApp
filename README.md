Note Taking App

Overview

This is a simple Note Taking App built in Java that allows users to create, remove, and display notes. Each note consists of a title, body, and timestamp to keep track of when it was created. The app uses a List to manage the notes and provides a simple console interface to interact with the app.

Features

Add Notes: Users can create a new note by providing a title and body text.
Remove Notes: Users can remove notes by title.
Display Notes: Users can view all their notes, including their title, body, and creation timestamp.
Technologies Used

Scanner (for user input from the console)
ArrayList (for storing the list of notes)
